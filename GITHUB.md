# **Intro**

### Git

Git is an open source version control system used to track changes to projects. It's a very popular source code management (SCM) tool used at the foundation of GitHub.<br/>

### GitHub

GitHub is a cloud based file sharing service that uses Git to manage content.<br/>

# **Repositories**

Repositories are the project folders of Git. A remote repository stored in the cloud is cloned to your local machine workspace. Next you add any changed files to a staging area. Then you save and describe what changes you made to your local repository. Finally, you push your changes back to the remote repository to share with others.

# **Branches**

Branches are different version of a repository used to develope in isolation. The `main` branch is the primary version of a repository. Project and feature branches are a modified copy of `main`. When development is completed the branch is merged into it's parent branch, which is most likely `main`.

# **Interfaces**

There exist many different terminal and GUI style interfaces. Git Bash is a very popular terminal command line interface while GitHub Desktop is a popular GUI interface. Linux and MacOS computer may already have command line interfaces. Download Git and Git Bash at minimum to get started with GitHub.

- Git Bash: [git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- GitHub Desktop: [desktop.github.com](https://desktop.github.com/)

*Note: Git Bash comes packaged with Git*
