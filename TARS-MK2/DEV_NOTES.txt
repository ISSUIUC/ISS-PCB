	GENERAL - Ayberk:
	- Set up a kicad project from scratch for TARS-MK2
	- Imported ISS logos for schematics and for PCB drawings. Just copied over from MK1

	FCB - Ayberk:
	- Imported footprint and symbol for the OSD3358-512M-BCB SiP (system in package).
		Note: I discovered that this particular variant isn't actually what's used on the PocketBeagle.
		I though the PocketBeagle was using this which integrates eMMC memory onto a single package, but aparrantly they
		just ditched eMMC altogether and are booting from the SD card alone on the PocketBeagle. This chip integrates eMMC
		which is much better for us, and there's many available reference designs to work off of.
	- Imported footprint and symbol for the NXP MIMX1062RT1062DVJA which is the microcontroller used on the Teensy4.1
		Pad sizes aren't too bad but spacing between pads will be tight for JLCPCB's minimum via diameter.
	- Imported a library for the TLV75733PDRV LDO IC only to realize Kicad comes with one. Its much more accurate too :)
	- Began adding simple things like decoupling capacitors and the TLV75733 according to the T4.1 schematic
	- Following the part labels found on the T4.1 schematic. i.e. a part with label U12 on the schematic from PJRC.com is labeled
		as U512 or U412 in kicad. 400 or 500 is added because the two MCU schematics have numbers 4 and 5 in the project.
	
	COTS - Kenneth:
	- Added footprints for COTS altimeters, solder points and mounting points included with the silkscreen
	- Added schematics for COTS altimeters, yet to connect to battery connectors
	- Mounting points pulled from local library (ISO 7380 standard) to prevent damage to copper layer of PCB

	FCB - Ayberk:
	- Added a bunch more decoupling capacitors and passive component related to power.
	- NOTE: Omitting the TPD3S014 IC as it is only used ESD protection when the Teensy is a USB host, not useful for us.
	- Added MKL02Z32VFG4 bootloader IC which conveniently comes with Kicad. Did not connect yet.
