	GENERAL - Ayberk:
	- Set up a kicad project from scratch for TARS-MK2
	- Imported ISS logos for schematics and for PCB drawings. Just copied over from MK1


[01/17/2021]
	FCB - Ayberk:
	- Imported footprint and symbol for the OSD3358-512M-BCB SiP (system in package).
		Note: I discovered that this particular variant isn't actually what's used on the PocketBeagle.
		I though the PocketBeagle was using this which integrates eMMC memory onto a single package, but aparrantly they
		just ditched eMMC altogether and are booting from the SD card alone on the PocketBeagle. This chip integrates eMMC
		which is much better for us, and there's many available reference designs to work off of.
	- Imported footprint and symbol for the NXP MIMX1062RT1062DVJA which is the microcontroller used on the Teensy4.1
		Pad sizes aren't too bad but spacing between pads will be tight for JLCPCB's minimum via diameter.
	- Imported a library for the TLV75733PDRV LDO IC only to realize Kicad comes with one. Its much more accurate too :)
	- Began adding simple things like decoupling capacitors and the TLV75733 according to the T4.1 schematic
	- Following the part labels found on the T4.1 schematic. i.e. a part with label U12 on the schematic from PJRC.com is labeled
		as U512 or U412 in kicad. 400 or 500 is added because the two MCU schematics have numbers 4 and 5 in the project.
	
	COTS - Kenneth:
	- Added footprints for COTS altimeters, solder points and mounting points included with the silkscreen
	- Added schematics for COTS altimeters, yet to connect to battery connectors
	- Mounting points pulled from local library (ISO 7380 standard) to prevent damage to copper layer of PCB

[01/18/2021]
	FCB - Ayberk:
	- Added a bunch more decoupling capacitors and passive component related to power.
	- NOTE: Omitting the TPD3S014 IC as it is only used ESD protection when the Teensy is a USB host, not useful for us.
	- Added MKL02Z32VFG4 bootloader IC which conveniently comes with Kicad. Did not connect yet.


[01/19/2021]
	FCB - Rohini, Maya, and Kenneth:
	- Added Micro-SD and the Microcontroller Booth Loader
	- NOTE: Still looking for power, it is currently labeled with text ('POWER')
	- NOTE: Wiring is very ugly 
	- Still need to find W25Q64JVXGIM (Planning to work on it)


[01/20/2021]
	FCB - Maya, Rohini
	- Added W25Q64JVXGIM (serial flash memory)
	- Couldn't find the exact symbol for this component, either in KiCad or online
	- Used the 32 Mb W25Q32JVSS symbol from the KiCad library and edited the symbol properties
	- Not sure if that's the correct method, but will check with the rest of the team
	- NOTE: Wrote in power using text ('POWER')
	
	POWER - Erika
	-Re-organized the locations of a few files to properly load the voltage regulators in Kicad
	-Fixed the orientation of pinholes on the two smaller regulators (D24V50F5 + D36V28F3)


[01/21/2020]
	ACB - Ayberk:
	- Imported symbol and footprint libraries from MK1
	- Found a .step file of Jetson Nano developer kit from Nvidia. Cherry-picked the parts we want including the SODIMM
		socket and made a separate .step file to include in Kicad 3d library. Looks pretty hot.
	- Connected power/ground and some input decoupling caps.
	- Made labels for I2C and SPI connections available
	TODO:
	- ESD protection diodes didn't have libraries. Either a library or a substitute needs to be found.
	- Understand SoM pin logic levels. They could be 1.8V which would require level shifting.

	FCB - Ben
	- Added tags between U502, U501B, and U501C to clean up wire mess
	- Added 'VBAT' tag to SD Card VDD pin (3.3 volts, double check)
	- Re-labeled U3 to U503 (flash memory) and J2 to J502 (micro sd)

	FCB - Rohini, Maya
	- Added PSRAM chip 
	- Having some issues pushing Rohini's changes; will be resolved shortly

	FCB - Rohini
	- Added Flash
	- NOTE:Connected wires to label, so there isn't a junction present in the schematic
	- Need to change footprint for PSRAM, Flash, and W25Q64JVXGIM

[01/22/2020]
	GENERAL - Ayberk:
	- Made four different kicad .pro project files for each board. The fact that they share the exact names as the relevant
		schematic files makes kicad automatically associate the schematic with the project file. pretty nice
	- Did a project-wide merge. First merged everything into main (resolving a few simple conflicts) then merged main back
		into every single branch.

	ACB - Ayberk:
	- Added labels for I2C connections
	- Added power on led circuitry

[01/23/2020]
	ACB - Ayberk:
	- Fixed I2C labeling mistake
	- Also added another bus called CAM_I2C on the dev kit. It can be used for general purpose too.
	- Copied 3V3 and 1V8 power supply schematics from the dev kit.
	- Re-organized jetson nano library folder by throwing all 3d files into one folder.

[01/24/2021]
	FCB - Maya, Rohini
	- Added library for ethernet just in case we ever want it
	- Added symbol and footprint for W25Q64JVXGIM; replaced old symbol with the new one
	- Started looking for footprint for PSRAM and flash (optional components)
	- NOTE: Mouser sometimes has symbols and footprints as ECAD models. These can be installed as long as you don't use Linux.  

[01/27/2021]
	FCB - Maya
	- Replaced old PSRAM symbol with ESP-PSRAM32 (this one has the correct footprint)
	- Replaced old flash symbol with W25Q128JVS (this one also has the correct footprint)
	- Redid connections between these two chips 

[01/30/2021](David's Nephew's Birthday)
	FCB - David, Maya
	- added symbol and footprint library to FCB libs, for the SD card (SD_1040310811)
	- added SD Card symbol to MPU schematic, and wired DATA/GND lines
	- we do not know the meaning of SW-1 and SW-2 pins, cursory google searches were unhelpful
	- Data3/CD(Chip Detect) line is hooked up to DATA3, but we may need to connect it to something else as well.


	FCB - Ayberk, Erika
	- Connected Grounds!
	- Added power inputs for VIN_AC and VIN_USB ports. May need to investigate power input protection here.
	- Added SYS_VDD3_3P3V internal rail to power the I/O domains (VDDSHVx pins) and connected to SYS_VDD3_3P3V@x pins
	- Similarly connected SYS_VDD_1P8V flag to SYS_VDD_1P8V@x pins
	- Connected VDDS and associated RTC pins to 1.8V power rail (SYS_RTC_1P8V)
	- Connected VREFP TO SYS_VDD_1P8V, and VREFN to GND. May need to consider resistor/bypass capacitors respectively. 
	
	FCB - Ayberk
	- Fixed labeling mistakes in the MCU_AC schematic.
	- Rearanged some circuitry in MCU_AC in discrete blocks. Mostly for aesthetics.
	- Added a pin connection to trigger the MKL02 bootloader in place of the pushbutton found on the Teensy4.1.
		This was done because pushbuttons can be susceptible to vibrations.

[01/31/2021]
	FCB - Ayberk
	- Fixed a couple misalignments in the power connections (purely aesthetic)
	- Added surface test points for all chip power rails and PMIC status pins.
	- Added 01x02 pin headers for power and reset buttons in case we weed it for debugging.
	- Added 01x02 pin header for I2C0 bus. It will only be used for PMIC control, but I exposed it for debug/expansion.
	- Added power LED on SYS_VDD2_3P3V rail. The rail isn't used for anything else.

[02/04/2021]
	FCB - Ayberk
	- Imported Kenneth's dxf board outline to FCB pcb project.
	- Put M3 3.2mm holes with vias exactly where the holes in the dxf file are.
	- Drew a ground ring on both sides of the board for ESD and EMI protection. I have yet to add spaced vias.
		Do we even need vias in the ring?
		Will the board edges be plated? (would be sooo cool)

[02/04/2021]
	FCB - David, Maya, Rohini
	- added lib files for usb-a connector, and tps(in Mouser_Imported_Components) that will be used for the usb
	- initial implementation for usb-a connection
	- Created Mouser_Imported_Components lib file for components imported with the Mouser library tool
		Need to copy the .lib file in the Mouser_Imported_Components to your local dummy folder for importing mouser tools
		and then copy it back to the Mouser_Imported_Components file in order to maintain the symbol library and add your new symbol

[02/10/2021]
	FCB - David, Maya
	- Did USB1 HOST schematic
	- Did USB0 CLIENT schematic
	- NOTE: used a 0-ohm resistor for USB0 CLIENT USB-DC connection
	- NOTE: connected chassis ground on USB0 CLIENT to GND1 instead of GND

[09/27/2021]

	- Added Molex connectors duplicating desing from FCB.sch
		- Added 505578-0671 2.00mm connectors for B2B power
