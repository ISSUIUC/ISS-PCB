[01/15/2021]
	GENERAL - Ayberk:
	- Set up a kicad project from scratch for TARS-MK2
	- Imported ISS logos for schematics and for PCB drawings. Just copied over from MK1


[01/17/2021]
	FCB - Ayberk:
	- Imported footprint and symbol for the OSD3358-512M-BCB SiP (system in package).
		Note: I discovered that this particular variant isn't actually what's used on the PocketBeagle.
		I though the PocketBeagle was using this which integrates eMMC memory onto a single package, but aparrantly they
		just ditched eMMC altogether and are booting from the SD card alone on the PocketBeagle. This chip integrates eMMC
		which is much better for us, and there's many available reference designs to work off of.
	- Imported footprint and symbol for the NXP MIMX1062RT1062DVJA which is the microcontroller used on the Teensy4.1
		Pad sizes aren't too bad but spacing between pads will be tight for JLCPCB's minimum via diameter.
	- Imported a library for the TLV75733PDRV LDO IC only to realize Kicad comes with one. Its much more accurate too :)
	- Began adding simple things like decoupling capacitors and the TLV75733 according to the T4.1 schematic
	- Following the part labels found on the T4.1 schematic. i.e. a part with label U12 on the schematic from PJRC.com is labeled
		as U512 or U412 in kicad. 400 or 500 is added because the two MCU schematics have numbers 4 and 5 in the project.

	COTS - Kenneth:
	- Added footprints for COTS altimeters, solder points and mounting points included with the silkscreen
	- Added schematics for COTS altimeters, yet to connect to battery connectors
	- Mounting points pulled from local library (ISO 7380 standard) to prevent damage to copper layer of PCB

[01/18/2021]
	FCB - Ayberk:
	- Added a bunch more decoupling capacitors and passive component related to power.
	- NOTE: Omitting the TPD3S014 IC as it is only used ESD protection when the Teensy is a USB host, not useful for us.
	- Added MKL02Z32VFG4 bootloader IC which conveniently comes with Kicad. Did not connect yet.


[01/19/2021]
	FCB - Rohini, Maya, and Kenneth:
	- Added Micro-SD and the Microcontroller Booth Loader
	- NOTE: Still looking for power, it is currently labeled with text ('POWER')
	- NOTE: Wiring is very ugly
	- Still need to find W25Q64JVXGIM (Planning to work on it)


[01/20/2021]
	FCB - Maya, Rohini
	- Added W25Q64JVXGIM (serial flash memory)
	- Couldn't find the exact symbol for this component, either in KiCad or online
	- Used the 32 Mb W25Q32JVSS symbol from the KiCad library and edited the symbol properties
	- Not sure if that's the correct method, but will check with the rest of the team
	- NOTE: Wrote in power using text ('POWER')

	POWER - Erika
	-Re-organized the locations of a few files to properly load the voltage regulators in Kicad
	-Fixed the orientation of pinholes on the two smaller regulators (D24V50F5 + D36V28F3)


[01/21/2020]
	ACB - Ayberk:
	- Imported symbol and footprint libraries from MK1
	- Found a .step file of Jetson Nano developer kit from Nvidia. Cherry-picked the parts we want including the SODIMM
		socket and made a separate .step file to include in Kicad 3d library. Looks pretty hot.
	- Connected power/ground and some input decoupling caps.
	- Made labels for I2C and SPI connections available
	TODO:
	- ESD protection diodes didn't have libraries. Either a library or a substitute needs to be found.
	- Understand SoM pin logic levels. They could be 1.8V which would require level shifting.

	FCB - Ben
	- Added tags between U502, U501B, and U501C to clean up wire mess
	- Added 'VBAT' tag to SD Card VDD pin (3.3 volts, double check)
	- Re-labeled U3 to U503 (flash memory) and J2 to J502 (micro sd)

	FCB - Rohini, Maya
	- Added PSRAM chip
	- Having some issues pushing Rohini's changes; will be resolved shortly

	FCB - Rohini
	- Added Flash
	- NOTE:Connected wires to label, so there isn't a junction present in the schematic
	- Need to change footprint for PSRAM, Flash, and W25Q64JVXGIM

[01/22/2020]
	GENERAL - Ayberk:
	- Made four different kicad .pro project files for each board. The fact that they share the exact names as the relevant
		schematic files makes kicad automatically associate the schematic with the project file. pretty nice
	- Did a project-wide merge. First merged everything into main (resolving a few simple conflicts) then merged main back
		into every single branch.

	ACB - Ayberk:
	- Added labels for I2C connections
	- Added power on led circuitry

[01/23/2020]
	ACB - Ayberk:
	- Fixed I2C labeling mistake
	- Also added another bus called CAM_I2C on the dev kit. It can be used for general purpose too.
	- Copied 3V3 and 1V8 power supply schematics from the dev kit.
	- Re-organized jetson nano library folder by throwing all 3d files into one folder.

	COTS - Kenneth:
	- Added 3D files to be included in the footprint for the SL and TM.

[01/24/2021]
	FCB - Maya, Rohini
	- Added library for ethernet just in case we ever want it
	- Added symbol and footprint for W25Q64JVXGIM; replaced old symbol with the new one
	- Started looking for footprint for PSRAM and flash (optional components)
	- NOTE: Mouser sometimes has symbols and footprints as ECAD models. These can be installed as long as you don't use Linux.

[01/27/2021]
	FCB - Maya
	- Replaced old PSRAM symbol with ESP-PSRAM32 (this one has the correct footprint)
	- Replaced old flash symbol with W25Q128JVS (this one also has the correct footprint)
	- Redid connections between these two chips

[01/30/2021](David's Nephew's Birthday)
	FCB - David, Maya
	- added symbol and footprint library to FCB libs, for the SD card (SD_1040310811)
	- added SD Card symbol to MPU schematic, and wired DATA/GND lines
	- we do not know the meaning of SW-1 and SW-2 pins, cursory google searches were unhelpful
	- Data3/CD(Chip Detect) line is hooked up to DATA3, but we may need to connect it to something else as well.

	FCB - Ayberk, Erika
	- Connected Grounds!
	- Added power inputs for VIN_AC and VIN_USB ports. May need to investigate power input protection here.
	- Added SYS_VDD3_3P3V internal rail to power the I/O domains (VDDSHVx pins) and connected to SYS_VDD3_3P3V@x pins
	- Similarly connected SYS_VDD_1P8V flag to SYS_VDD_1P8V@x pins
	- Connected VDDS and associated RTC pins to 1.8V power rail (SYS_RTC_1P8V)
	- Connected VREFP TO SYS_VDD_1P8V, and VREFN to GND. May need to consider resistor/bypass capacitors respectively.

	FCB - Ayberk
	- Fixed labeling mistakes in the MCU_AC schematic.
	- Rearanged some circuitry in MCU_AC in discrete blocks. Mostly for aesthetics.
	- Added a pin connection to trigger the MKL02 bootloader in place of the pushbutton found on the Teensy4.1.
		This was done because pushbuttons can be susceptible to vibrations.

[01/31/2021]
	FCB - Ayberk
	- Fixed a couple misalignments in the power connections (purely aesthetic)
	- Added surface test points for all chip power rails and PMIC status pins.
	- Added 01x02 pin headers for power and reset buttons in case we weed it for debugging.
	- Added 01x02 pin header for I2C0 bus. It will only be used for PMIC control, but I exposed it for debug/expansion.
	- Added power LED on SYS_VDD2_3P3V rail. The rail isn't used for anything else.

[02/03/2021]
	FCB - Maya, David
	- Added footprint for 104031-811 micro-SD card from Mouser
	- Fully connected micro-SD card symbol to MPU
	- Grounded the SW-1 and SW-2 pins

[02/04/2021]
	FCB - Ayberk
	- Imported Kenneth's dxf board outline to FCB pcb project.
	- Put M3 3.2mm holes with vias exactly where the holes in the dxf file are.
	- Drew a ground ring on both sides of the board for ESD and EMI protection. I have yet to add spaced vias.
		Do we even need vias in the ring?
		Will the board edges be plated? (would be sooo cool)

	FCB - David, Maya, Rohini
	- added lib files for usb-a connector, and tps(in Mouser_Imported_Components) that will be used for the usb
	- initial implementation for usb-a connection
	- Created Mouser_Imported_Components lib file for components imported with the Mouser library tool
		Need to copy the .lib file in the Mouser_Imported_Components to your local dummy folder for importing mouser tools
		and then copy it back to the Mouser_Imported_Components file in order to maintain the symbol library and add your new symbol

[02/10/2021]
	FCB - David, Maya
	- Did USB1 HOST schematic
	- Did USB0 CLIENT schematic
	- NOTE: used a 0-ohm resistor for USB0 CLIENT USB-DC connection
	- NOTE: connected chassis ground on USB0 CLIENT to GND1 instead of GND

[02/14/2021]
	General - Ayberk
	- Performed a project-wide merge across all branches to keep things semi synced.
	- Copied the board outline for the FCB with the ground ring to all the other boards. Looks pretty neat

[02/15/2021]
	FCB - Ayberk
	- Switched all global labels in MCU schematics to hierarchical labels. This practice should be followed throughout the project.
	- Added labels for _all_ GPIO pins to make connecting things easier in the future.
	- Added ABS07-32.768KHZ-T crystal oscillator for the OSC1 input which is used for RTC. The OSC0 clock is supplied internally.
	- Added a test point for OSC0_CTL (high when enabled)
	- Imported CTI 20 pin JTAG header which uses the FTR-110-03-G-D-06 connector and a pin mapping specific to TI debuggers.
	- Added 3D .step files for the OSD3358, the MIMXRT1062s and the JTAG connector. very nice.

[02/16/2021]
	FCB - Henry
	- Copied LSM9DS1 from MK-1 to FCB on MK-2
	- NOTE: Labels for capacitors and sensor need to be checked--I didn't name them.
	- Copied KX122-1040(which is actually 1711) and MS5611 sensors from MK-1 to MK-2
	- NOTE: Labels for capacitors, jumpers, and sensors need to be added.

[02/17/2021]
	FCB - Vincent
	- Copied ZOE-M8Q schematic from TARS MK1 to MK2

	FCB - Ayberk
	- Imported a 3D step file for the ZOE-M8Q
	- The paths for the footprint libraries Vincent imported earlier didn't show up. Had to re-add them.
	- Assigned footprints to a bunch (but not all) passives.


	FCB - Justin
	- Added the BNO055 IMU to the FCB

[02/18/2021]
	FCB - Justin and Vincent
	- We met to discuss how to integrate the BNO055 IMU
	- Vincent downloaded the file from the SnapEDA and tried to extract it on KICAD but it wouldn't load
	- We will finish this during Saturday's meeting

[02/20/2021]
	FCB - Ayberk
	- Spent a while understanding the hardware of the ZOE-M8Q GPS module.
	- Added a bunch of solder-jumpers that will allow us to select SPI vs UART+I2C communication.
	- Added a backup battery (no footprint yet)
	- Added test points for using with an external programmer if needed. (make these simple pin headers?)
	- Took the antenna bias tee design from Sparkfun's breakout board.
		- Found this reddit thread asking about the bias tee. Using bias tees with passive antennas is big bad.
		  https://www.reddit.com/r/AskElectronics/comments/lfiivy/help_with_gps_chip_antenna/
		- SF schematics does not show ferrite bead impedance so I took the 120 Ohm value from the design in the reddit thread.
	- Also added an LED to the TIMEPULSE pin which will blink at 1Hz presumably when there is a GPS lock. might be pretty
	- Added RTC crystal with 3.2mmX1.5mm footprint
	- +input decoupling cap

	FCB - Justin
	- Deleted the old layout of the FCB
	- Placed some major components onto the FCB
	- (Just put the general locations, not fixed)

[02/21/2021]
	FCB - Ayberk
	- Added libraries for 1.14" 135x140 IPS TFT Display from Adafruit
		Adafruit doesn't sell the standalone panel but it can be found here:
		https://www.displaymodule.com/products/1-14-135x240-ips-tft-display-module-spi?variant=31355292647522
	- Made a oval cutout for the display's ribbon cable.

	FCB - Ayberk and Henry
	- Added Footprint and Symbol for 1.25mm Molex connector
	- Modified Footprint from an 8 connector 1.25mm Molex connecter of the same type found online.

	FCB - Maya, Rohini
	- Added footprints to components in MPU sheet:
		- TPD4S012DRYR
		- TPS2051BDR
		- Micro-USB connectors
		- USB-A connector
	- A few small components may still be missing footprints; Rohini and I will fix those on Wednesday 2/24 morning

[02/22/2021]
	FCB - Ayberk
	- Added MicroUSB connector for MCU_AC along with a few power components.
	- Fixed line alignments for the 6pos molex connectors imported earlier today (cosmetic)
	- Added a 3D .stp file for the 6pos 1.25mm MLPlus connectors
	- Added the 1.25mm signam MLPlus connectors to the FCB schematic and placed them on to the board layout where it made sense
	- NOTICE: The MicroUSB for the MPU is duplicated. Seems like another one was accidentally placed instead of connecting a label.
	- TODO: MCU Crystal oscillator circuity
		Assigning hierarchical pins to match most of MK1 connections
		Status LEDs
		Buzzer?
		RFM95!!!
		Maybe add MPU9250 instead of BNO055
		MCU test points are probably a good idea
		W25Q64 Flash IC doesn't have a footprint!!!

[2/24/2021]
	COTS - Justin
	- Deleted the old traces on the COTS board
	- Calculated the minimum width of the wire
	- Added some new traces with the new wire width
	- Switched the order of connections to avoid overlap

	FCB - Maya, Rohini
	- Added footprints to a few small components (Ferrite beads)

[2/25/2021]
	COTS - Justin and Ben
	-Finished adding traces on COTS board
	-Via size is too small? (Under stratologger)
	-We may come back to make it look better (A E S T H E T I C)

[02/26/2021]
	FCB - Henry! :)
	- Copied and modified footprint and symbol of 2 circuit 2mm Molex connector to make a 6 circuit 2mm Molex connector.
	- Created folders for Molex_Connector folder footprints and symbols, made new pathways for footprints.

[2/27/2021]
	COTS - Ben
	- Fixed minor spacing errors
	- via size too small?

[IMPORTANT ORGANIZATION CHANGE 02/28/2021]
	Ayberk
	- Did a project-wide merge into main
	- Discontinuing the branch structure and continuing on main only. Makes more sense since 90% of work is being done on FCB
	- Eliminated the TARS-MK2 project and all associated files. It was only causing confusion. All board will be done in their
		respective .pro projects.
	- Moved the Jetson Nano 3d step file to local libraries so it doesn't yell at you when it can't find it 

[3/06/2021] 
	FCB - Rohini and Maya
	- Copied sensors and labels from MCU_AC to MCU_HYBRID
	- Adjusted labels to match new sheet
	- Going to work on the pins for MCU_AC and MCU_HYBRID tomorrow
	- Need to check if boot loader and optional memory should be copied from MCU_AC to MCU_HYBRID

[03/07/2021]
	FCB - Maya, Rohini
	- Copied bootloader and optional memory from MCU_AC to MCU_HYBRID
	- Adjusted labels to match new sheet

[03/12/2021]
	FCB - Maya, Rohini
	- Started to add pin associations, but then got a bit confused
	- Going to meet later today and figure it out

	FCB - Maya, Rohini
	- Finished Teensy4.1 pin associations (we are no longer confused thanks to Ayberk)
	- Put a nice box around the pin associations

[03/12/2021]
	FCB - Ben
	- added connections for MPU-9250
	- NEED CONFIRMATION ON CS AND INT1 pins
	- removed BMI160 IMU


	COTS - Ben
	- Cleaned up traces
	- added ground plane
	- shifted stratologger up to make room for molex
	- added outline for ziptie holes
	- added 6-pin molex connectors

	FCB - Henry
	- Copied RFM95W from MK-1 to MK-2 FCB
	- NOTE- I had some issues with the footprint so I'm not a hundred percent sure if it was implemented correctly.
	
[03/13/2021]
	FCB - Ayberk
	- Created a "three-way resistor" footprint to be able to switch MPU SYSBOOT configuration pins.
	- Added the SYSBOOT resistors copying everything except the boot sequence from the OSD3358 tutorial pdf.
	- Fixed a few naming duplicates between MCU_AC and MCU_HYBRID

[03/14/2021]
	FCB - Ayberk
	- Did a lot of little minute tweaks to the ESD ring. Essentially gave pad connecting to the ring some thermal relief through discrete traces.
	- Re-organized FCB.sch and removed all Global labels in place of hierarchical labels.
	- Replaced the RFM95 symbol with the Kicad built-in one becuase it was more compact (Sorry Henry)
	- Added symbol for the LCD screen.
	- Added 3D models for the MLPlus 6Pos 2.00mm connectors
	- Worked out the minimum trace width and via sizes that JLCPCB can manufacture. Seems like we are in good shape regarding tolerances. (phew)

[03/15/2021]
	FCB- Vincent and Henry
	-Connected the 4 sensors to the MCU. The MISO, MOSI, CS, and SCK for each were added.
	-Note* KX122 CS line check the pin that connected to it.
	 
[03/17/2021]
	FCB - Ben, Henry and Aychad ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
	- Fixed hierarchical tags from MCUs
	- Started MISO, MOSI, and SCK connections between MCUs
	- Applied 'MINNIMUM' trace settings to MCUs and sensors
	- Rotated MCUs for cool orientation

[03/18/2021]
	FCB - Ben and Henry
	- Started SPI bus connections
	- 2 CS pins on barometer??

[03/19/2021]
	FCB - Ayberk
	- Routed a lot of the MKL02 and crystal connections for MCU_AC.
	- Noticed the MKL02 schematic hierarchical label had mistaken O's for 0s. Woops. Fixed for MCU_AC but not for MCU_HYBRID
		- TODO: Fix MKL02 labels in MCU_HYBRID
	- Shit's getting pretty tight
	- Shit's lookin pretty cool
	- WHy the fuck doe AE323 suck ass?

[03/20/2021]
