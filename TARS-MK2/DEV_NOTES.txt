	GENERAL - Ayberk:
	- Set up a kicad project from scratch for TARS-MK2
	- Imported ISS logos for schematics and for PCB drawings. Just copied over from MK1


[01/17/2021]
	FCB - Ayberk:
	- Imported footprint and symbol for the OSD3358-512M-BCB SiP (system in package).
		Note: I discovered that this particular variant isn't actually what's used on the PocketBeagle.
		I though the PocketBeagle was using this which integrates eMMC memory onto a single package, but aparrantly they
		just ditched eMMC altogether and are booting from the SD card alone on the PocketBeagle. This chip integrates eMMC
		which is much better for us, and there's many available reference designs to work off of.
	- Imported footprint and symbol for the NXP MIMX1062RT1062DVJA which is the microcontroller used on the Teensy4.1
		Pad sizes aren't too bad but spacing between pads will be tight for JLCPCB's minimum via diameter.
	- Imported a library for the TLV75733PDRV LDO IC only to realize Kicad comes with one. Its much more accurate too :)
	- Began adding simple things like decoupling capacitors and the TLV75733 according to the T4.1 schematic
	- Following the part labels found on the T4.1 schematic. i.e. a part with label U12 on the schematic from PJRC.com is labeled
		as U512 or U412 in kicad. 400 or 500 is added because the two MCU schematics have numbers 4 and 5 in the project.

	COTS - Kenneth:
	- Added footprints for COTS altimeters, solder points and mounting points included with the silkscreen
	- Added schematics for COTS altimeters, yet to connect to battery connectors
	- Mounting points pulled from local library (ISO 7380 standard) to prevent damage to copper layer of PCB

	FCB - Ayberk:
	- Added a bunch more decoupling capacitors and passive component related to power.
	- NOTE: Omitting the TPD3S014 IC as it is only used ESD protection when the Teensy is a USB host, not useful for us.
	- Added MKL02Z32VFG4 bootloader IC which conveniently comes with Kicad. Did not connect yet.


[01/19/2021]
	FCB - Rohini, Maya, and Kenneth:
	- Added Micro-SD and the Microcontroller Booth Loader
	- NOTE: Still looking for power, it is currently labeled with text ('POWER')
	- NOTE: Wiring is very ugly
	- Still need to find W25Q64JVXGIM (Planning to work on it)


[01/20/2021]
	FCB - Maya, Rohini
	- Added W25Q64JVXGIM (serial flash memory)
	- Couldn't find the exact symbol for this component, either in KiCad or online
	- Used the 32 Mb W25Q32JVSS symbol from the KiCad library and edited the symbol properties
	- Not sure if that's the correct method, but will check with the rest of the team
	- NOTE: Wrote in power using text ('POWER')


[01/21/2020]
	ACB - Ayberk:
	- Imported symbol and footprint libraries from MK1
	- Found a .step file of Jetson Nano developer kit from Nvidia. Cherry-picked the parts we want including the SODIMM
		socket and made a separate .step file to include in Kicad 3d library. Looks pretty hot.
	- Connected power/ground and some input decoupling caps.
	- Made labels for I2C and SPI connections available
	TODO:
	- ESD protection diodes didn't have libraries. Either a library or a substitute needs to be found.
	- Understand SoM pin logic levels. They could be 1.8V which would require level shifting.

	FCB - Ben
	- Added tags between U502, U501B, and U501C to clean up wire mess
	- Added 'VBAT' tag to SD Card VDD pin (3.3 volts, double check)
	- Re-labeled U3 to U503 (flash memory) and J2 to J502 (micro sd)

	FCB - Rohini, Maya
	- Added PSRAM chip
	- Having some issues pushing Rohini's changes; will be resolved shortly

	FCB - Rohini
	- Added Flash
	- NOTE:Connected wires to label, so there isn't a junction present in the schematic
	- Need to change footprint for PSRAM, Flash, and W25Q64JVXGIM

[1/23/2020]

	COTS - Kenneth:
	- Added 3D files to be included in the footprint for the SL and TM.
