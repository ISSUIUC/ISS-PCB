Welcome to the ISS-PCB repo! 

# Repository Overview

* Archive: Contains all past projects that the team has worked on, including Tars Mk1, Mk2, and Mk3
* Boards: Contains all of the present boards the team is working on
* Docs: Contains various documents pertaining to PCB designs
* Libs: Contains various templates, symbols and footprints that we use when designing PCBs
* Scripts: Contains various codes used in PCB development

When you commit changes to the repository, they will generally be found in the Boards folder. 

# How to contribute:
There are many ways to contribute to the PCBs that we build for the rocket and its accompanying systems. The timeline for building a PCB is usually as follows: 

* Formulate the requirements of the board
* Research different chips, understand their functionalities, and determine if we can use it for our purposes
* Build the board schematic using the datasheets of different chips 
* Route the board 
* Once the board is manufactured, solder all the components onto the board
* Debug the board 
* Document the board (this should be done throughout the process as well) 

Every part of constructing a PCB is hands-on, and there are lots of ways to get involved. 

To have your changes reflected on the board, it is important to commit your changes to the Github repository. To learn how to commit changes, check out the [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/ISSUIUC/ISS-PCB/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
