TARS-MK1 PCB/Schematic design buglog:

[11/14/2020]
	- Pololu 3v3 and 5v step-down regulator footprints have incorrect pin offset relative to mounting holes
		Fix: Use solid core wires between regulator pads and PCB pads, fix in footprint for next design iteration.	
	
	- Stratologger hole locations are slightly wrong
		Fix: Possibly drill holes out with a dremel? Fix footprint for future design iteration

	- BBB hole locations are positioned slightly wrong
		Fix: Possibly dremel as before. Mounting holes will not be necessary when the SoC is integrated onto the PCB in future iterations.

	- Ayberk is a dummy and did not flip the BBB footprint
		Fix: flip the footprint
		Workaround: Attempting to desolder and relocate the female pin  headers to the other side of the board.

	- Pads around Teensy's pin holes are rather small and make it difficult to solder
		Fix: Increase pad diameter in next iterations.
