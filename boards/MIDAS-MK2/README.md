# MIDAS MK2

MIDAS MK2 is a new and improved generation of the MIDAS flight computer, designed for flight control of 3” diameter vehicles with a 25% size decrease in spite of numerous feature upgrades. MK2 continues MIDAS’s mission as the centerpiece of a flexible avionics ecosystem, featuring data acquisition, live telemetry, board-to-board communication interfaces, and pyrotechnic capabilities for in-flight control. MK2 retains the diverse suite of sensors from the original revision and features upgraded pyro circuitry with an emphasis on redundancy and reliability. As the team pushes closer and closer to space, this revision employs a new generation of LoRa radios with 60% higher transmit power as well as CAN and I2C connections for future expandability for satellite communications and other more advanced tracking capabilities. This adaptable nature has enabled MIDAS to fulfill various roles, not only as a flight computer but also as a part of the team’s onboard video system and as a major ground support device. Overall, these across-the-board improvements have pushed the MIDAS project to new heights and led to a string of successes in each of its many domains.

Three MIDAS MK2 boards have been produced, and the series has successfully flown in flight control of the Stargazer 1.4 vehicle and served as the primary trackers for Aether I & II, the latter of which flew to an altitude of 75,000 feet.
