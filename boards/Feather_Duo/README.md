# Feather Duo

The Feather Duo radio receiver was conceived to optimize communication with MIDAS and simplify the team’s ground station setup, including two LoRa radios for concurrent reception from both stages and software support for increased data rates. It succeeds the Adafruit Feather M0 RFM96 as the team’s primary ground station receiver.
