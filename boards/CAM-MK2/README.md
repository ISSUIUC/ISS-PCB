# CAM MK2

The CAM series of custom camera control boards is intended to power and command onboard RunCam FPV cameras for reliably recording of onboard rocket footage.

Bouncing back from the failure of CAM MK1, the team’s onboard video system saw a big leap forward with the success of CAM MK2. In addition to shrinking board size by 33%, MK2 features revamped power circuitry and additional camera control features, making it more flexible as it seeks to ensure proper operation of the vehicle’s cameras for the collection of visual data on in-flight events (and capturing some really cool views). Closely integrated with MIDAS through inter-board CAN and I2C interfaces, CAM is capable of receiving remote commands based on either the MIDAS FSM or telemetry communications from the ground station. As the first peripheral board designed to talk directly with MIDAS, CAM serves as a pioneer of connectivity in the MIDAS ecosystem and has flown successfully several times.
