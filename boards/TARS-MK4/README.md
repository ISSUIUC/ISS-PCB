# TARS MK4

TARS MK4 is the teamâ€™s fourth generation of SRAD avionics systems and is the culmination of two years of refinement beginning with TARS MK3. At its foundation TARS is a flexible platform developed for advanced data acquisition, live telemetry monitoring, an active control system, and redundant COTS altimeters. When compared against the backdrop of TARS MK3, MK4 features more advanced sensing, a reinforced active control mechanism, and
a smaller footprint. In the future TARS will serve as a test bed for more advanced systems such as live video streaming, SRAD recovery, and extreme high altitude state estimation.
