# MotorBoard

Starting off the year as just a concept, the Motor Board has taken shape as an impressive new piece of the MIDAS ecosystem. Unofficially known as “Spinny Antenna Motor” (SAM) Board, the project serves as a method of control for the team’s SAM Turret antenna tracker, which aims to automatically track the rocket’s position during flight and maintain optimal antenna orientation to get the best possible range for MIDAS telemetry. In addition to cementing MIDAS’s role as an important part of our team’s ground operations, the Motor Board has served as a testbed for WiFi as a new way of board-to-board communication.
