# Onboarding Projects

The included projects have been developed for the purpose of teaching new members about the basics of circuit design and using KiCad.

The first project includes a 555 Timer that is used to flash several LEDs. This project is accompanied by other onboarding materials which explain how to use the 555 Timer and develop the circuit. There are also videos going through the [schematic](https://youtu.be/EWncukrDE1s) and [layout](https://youtu.be/gsBfX4-ESjE) design.

The second project is a basic altimeter that could be used in an L1 rocket. It is intended to be more open-ended, and the included design can serve as merely an example. The altimeter includes an MCU, sensors connected via the SPI and I2C communication protocols, a microSD card for data storage, and basic power circuitry that can be used with an external voltage regulator.
